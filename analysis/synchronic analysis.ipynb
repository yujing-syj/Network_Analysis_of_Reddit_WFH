       " \"Another WFH Scam I have been applying for jobs lately and got a text message about a work from home CSR job paying $22 an hour which seems a little high but not completely unrealistic.\\n\\nFirst red flag is that they texted me directly instead of an email or message through a job board. \\n\\nThe second red flag is that the interview was all through a MS Teams chat. Not a video chat just text. \\n\\nThere were a couple little errors in grammar during the chat that I was suspicious of, but I had also just completed a legit interview with a multi-national car manufacturer for a local on site position and I can understand having english as a second language, not everything is perfect. \\n\\nAlarm bells really started ringing when during the interview they asked if my phone carrier was pre-paid or post paid and who it was. \\n\\nThey also asked about direct deposit and who my bank was with and how long I had been a customer. Now normally I wouldn't lie in an interview but I told them it would be through one of the too big to fail banks. I figured I'd just open a new account if it turned out to be legit. I didn't even bother to answer about the time length. \\n\\nThey said they had gotten my resume online but they still needed my address. Yet another red flag. \\n\\nFinally the nuclear bomb drop was when they said they would have to send me a check to buy the equipment and would talk to me more on Monday. \\n\\nI found the website and a mention is Fast Company magazine through a google search and while it seems a real company, it still had some issues. No contact us links and no info on where HQ was. I found supposed employees on LinkedIn and one even seemed like she was in the role I had just been hired for. \\n\\nI messaged her and the poor girl had been victimized by this scam and she helped to confirm all my suspicions. \\n\\nThe company name is Cabinet Health and they are in Series B startup mode so it might be a real company. \\n\\nTL:DR: If a company interviews you through chat only, it might be a scam. If they mention sending you a check to buy equipment, it is 100% a scam.\",\n",
